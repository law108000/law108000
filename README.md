# 👋 Hi there, I'm Lok!

I'm a seasoned software developer with over a decade of experience, starting from 2013. I've honed my skills in multiple programming languages and technologies, including:

1. PHP 🐘
2. Swift/Objective-C 🍎
3. Java ☕ (with expertise in Spring Boot for robust enterprise applications)
4. JavaScript/Typescript (Node.js, Vue, React) 🌐
5. C# 🎯
6. C++
7. HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System): proficient in handling big data storage and processing with HDFS.
8. Spark: skilled in leveraging Apache Spark for fast and reliable data processing.
9. Python: experienced in using Python for data analysis, machine learning, and automation tasks.

In addition to programming languages, I'm also well-versed in various databases, including MySQL, MSSQL, DB2, Elastic, and Mongo. I'm comfortable working with different operating systems, such as Linux/Mac and Windows Servers, using either Bash or PowerShell.

I have expertise in designing, deploying, and managing applications on various cloud platforms, including:
Azure
Google Cloud
Amazon Web Services (AWS)
IBM Cloud

To ensure scalability, reliability, and efficiency, I utilize containerization tools like Docker to package and deploy applications. Additionally, I leverage Kubernetes for orchestration and management of containerized workloads.
This allows me to efficiently manage the application lifecycle, scale resources on demand, and provide high availability and redundancy, even in complex distributed systems.

Feel free to reach out to me if you need any help with your next project or have any questions! 🤝
