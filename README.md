# 👋 Hi there, I'm Lok!

I'm a professional software developer with *over a decade of experience*, starting from 2013. I'm skilled in several programming languages, including:

1. PHP 🐘
2. Swift/Objective-C 🍎
3. Java ☕
4. JavaScript/Typescript (Node.js, Vue, React) 🌐
5. C# 🎯

Besides programming languages, I'm also proficient in various databases, such as MySQL, MSSQL, DB2, Elastic, and Mongo. I'm comfortable working with different operating systems, including Linux/Mac and Windows Servers, using either Bash or PowerShell.

For infrastructure and deployment, I prefer using Docker and Kubernetes to deploy products into different cloud platforms, such as Azure, Google Cloud, and more.

Feel free to reach out to me if you need any help with your next project or have any questions! 🤝
